No to be honest I'm doing this only to populate a bit my Github account and fill it with my `knowledge and solving problem skills` in order to create a little resume and a cool repository to watch, fork and pull :-)\r\n\r\n## What is Project Euler ? ##\r\n\r\nQuote from the site:\r\n\t\r\n\t«Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge,\r\n\tand develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest\r\n\tin the fascinating world of mathematics.»\r\n\t\r\nI think that Computer Science is strictly related to Mathematics so that's the basic idea: \r\n\t\r\n\t«Solving mathematics problems with programming languages»\r\n\r\nIt's nothing new I know, but I want to do it in a different way, I will create a folder for every problem set and inside it I will put the procedure in different programming languages, those who I know most of course.\r\n\r\nFor further readings about Project Euler see [the About page](http://projecteuler.net/about).\r\n\r\n## How do you solve the problems? ##\r\n\r\nActually I will solve the problems with:\r\n\r\n- `PHP`\r\n- `Python`\r\n- `Java`\r\n- `C`\r\n- `C++`\r\n- `C#`\r\n- `ADA`\r\n\r\nThose are the languages that I know at the moment. I don't know if I will add some other languages, it's not so easy.\r\n\r\n## Can I contribute to this? ##\r\n**OF COURSE YOU CAN, YOU HAVE TO :smile: **\r\n\r\n- If you want to pull a solution with different language, I will not cover EVERY problems with all languages, fell free to submit a pull request.\r\n- If you think that you have a faster, or better, solution, feel free to open an issue and we will discuss on it :-)\r\n\r\nThis is a project from everyone to everyone, no doubt about it. Once a pull request will be merged you will became a **SOLVER** se the `SOLVER.md` file for further details\r\n\r\n### Don't have a Project Euler account ? ###\r\n\r\nDon't worry, there's even the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file with everyone inside it :-)\r\n\r\n## What about License? ##\r\nI think that the proper license for this project is the GPLv2 license, se the `LICENSE` file for further details.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
